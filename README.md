### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nathalia (she/her), a software developer with more than 15 years of experience.

I have worked in many fields, going "up" and "down" on technologies, learning everything I can. Most of my experience comes from embedded development usign C, but I have been working on web development professionally since 2009, starting with ASP.net and now JavaScript and Typescript. Not professionally, I used to create web sites using pure HTML to be hosted on Geocities (1997) and then other hosts as they improved storage capacity and subdomains. ðŸ˜„

I have ADHD, OCD and bipolar disorder. This means I always have a lot of side projects in mind, but little or no time to actually execute them (I prefer spending my energy in my paid jobs, for obvious reasons), and also they must be perfect since the beginning and they are never perfect enough for me to actually start them.

Besides my development skills, I am also a tech lead and Scrum Master, but have performed as Product Owner and Product Manager as needed. Sometimes the four positions at once. I am very good at release planning, I can coordinate teams without leaving them feel any burden of due dates or problems that may arise during the development. I am very good at identifying and removing blockers, I always work toward a good planning execution.
